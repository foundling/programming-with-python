# Data Types 

The following are some common data types that we will be working with in this book. I've separated them into two categories: items that are indivisible and items that are aggregations of other items in some form or another.

    Simple Data Types
        + Numeric
            + int
            + float
            + long
        + Logical
            + bool

    Aggregate Data Types
    + Text
        + string
    + Collections
        + tuple
        + list
        + set
        + dict
    + Object Oriented Data Structures
        + class


Here are some brief examples illustrating the use of each of these items:

# Numbers

## The `int` Data Type
````
age = 30
print(age, type(age))
# 30, int

print(age + 1)
# 31
````
