# Who is This Book For? 

If you are new to programming or want to try it out but aren't really sure what it's all about, then this book is for you. It interleaves the 'practical' and 'theoretical', and is founded on the assumption that you ultimately find rewarding the 'brain-hurt' feeling of diving into a new system of thinking. But I'm not here to leave anyone in the dark.  You should expect practical examples meant to develop your ability to build readable and concise programs that do things you find interesting and challenging.

Fundamentals are important. This book emphasizes covering fundamentals from a variety of angles so you simply can't forget them.

**Q: With so many introductory books out there, why have you written another one?** 

I love Python. It was my first programming language and it is still a favorite. I believe it has a lot to teach about design simplicity and strength. The common truism is that Python is a good beginner language.  I concede this: Python code is fairly intuitive to write and read.  It has a great standard library and a great community as well. There is also a long term advantage, which comes from working in a language designed more or less by a single person who happens to be a great, practical-minded language designer. You learn patterns that seem like facts now, but later on reveal themselves as wise choices. There is a reason why seasoned software developers with years in many languages come to Python and stay with enthusiasm.
