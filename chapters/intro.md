# Introduction 

This book is for audiacious beginners and programmers unfamiliar with Python who want a thorough introduction to the language. I've taken an error-centric approach in order to develop understanding of the language from the converse perspective, by finding out what doesn't work and why.  I hope that instead of fearing or resenting error messages, you will have the confidence to treat them as a tool to become a better programmer. Many of the examples will contain errors that we will fix together.
