# Running your Code

## Getting Python onto your System

We're going to be using Python3 in this book. The simplest way to install Python3 currently is to use Continuum Analytics's Anaconda Python environment. This includes a lot more than you will need at first, but it makes running Python on whichever platform you're using very easy.

So, go here:

    https://www.continuum.io/downloads

and download Python3 installer for your platform. 

## Tools to Write and Run Code

The general flow of writing code goes like this: 

+ Write some code in a text editor and save it. This saves the lines you see to a file on your hard-drive.
+ Run the code from the file you've saved.

So you need a text editor. Here are some options:

+ Atom (graphical, free, open-source)
+ SublimeText3 (graphical, trial, closed-source)
+ TextWrangler (graphical, free)
