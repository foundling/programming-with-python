# Habits

This section is entirely skippable, just the things I'd wish I had known up front when I started programming,

There are no hard and fast habits that necessarily result in a good programmer, but it's good to avoid doing the stupid stuff.

Q: Stuff takes a while, and I don't have the attention span. How do I?

It pays off. Don't get attached to your code (but back it up, of course). Remember your triumphs, those make it worth it.  

Q: Should I go home?

No, you should go big.

Q: There are so many things to look up.

If you don't know something, force yourself to look it up. There *are* so many terms and areas of computer science, but in order to avoid spiraling off to nowhere in the internet of abundant links, look this thing up with a heavy bias toward finding out its relationship toward the first thing and get back to that first thing. 

Q: When should I read my code?

Read your own code after some time has passed.

Q: Who is my code?

Your code is communication. It is you.

Q: I hate deleting code I just wrote.

Get over deleting sections of your code. You are an engineer. You are always learning. If a line of code needs to be replaced, it should be due to functionality or elegance.

Do you want to be doing this? There are many better or al least healthier things to be doing than programming.

Q: It seems complicated to put a big project together.  

Many rewrites at first, but then you cn start to think clearly earlier. Articulate a plan of approach, and constantly revise that plan to express what you're doing. Solutions don't come when you want them, so it's best to just keep the problem clear in mind. 

Q: I feel alone

Read source code as a completely independent task from programming anything, and take notes. If you are literate in patterns and know what and how other people made their software, you have a tremendous advantage. 

Be cooperative if needed, but entirely skpetical of other's code. Some of it is successful, others not, and your longterm goal should be to tell which is which.

Q: What does that have to do with loneliness?

You may not know programmers or have anyone to talk to.  One meaningful way to feel valued and understood is to contribute to open source or find a collaborator.  

Q: What about programming? 

Functions are key. Divide a program into functions, they are your logical 'this is a single, discrete step in the process of solving the problem' building-blocks. 

Take time to improve certain parts of your skillset.  An example would be to read the Http1.1 spec, pick an http library, explore it through an interpreter, then write a program with it. 

Another would be to implement some data structures. 

Another would be to learn basic logic and set theory.

Q: Thanks.
Sure.
