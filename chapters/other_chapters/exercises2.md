# Filtering Usernames 

For the following exercises, we are going to take a list of usernames and filter that list based on varying criteria.

Here's the list:

    usernames = ['redsoxfan9000', 'djcarlos', 'donutman', '?uestlove', 'bbgun', 'rjd2c3po', 'videogamez', 'lilly99']

Hint: you will find the for loop construct useful here, as well as using some data type to hold intermediate values during the loop. 

#### Ex. 1 - Six or Shorter

Go through the items in `usernames` and pick out the usernames that are 6 or less characters long. Put them in a new list and print that list.

#### Ex. 2 - Seven or Longer

Do the same as you did in the previous exercise, but only target the usernames that are greater than 6 characters long.

#### Ex. 3 - Total Characters

Find the total number of characters that the list of usernames contains. Print that number.

#### Ex. 4 - Total Unique Characters

Find the total number of *unique* characters that the list of usernames contains

#### Ex. 5 - Most Numbers in Username

Find the username(s) that contain the most numbers 

#### Ex. 6 - Find the shortest username

#### Ex. 7 - Find the Longest username

### Ex. 8 - Get a list of usernames that contain a 'z' or a non-alphabetic character.
