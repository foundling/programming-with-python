# What is a Program?

The word 'program' is ambiguous. It is used to mean either the textfile that contains code or that the active process that results from that textfile being executed by a computer, depending on the context.

'My program crashed' -> the real-time process.
'My program is 115 lines long' -> the source file.

So there are two things to consider here when conceptualizing what you are taking part in as a programmer: writing the source code, which defines what should happen during the execution, and running that source code, which brings your code to life.

A program source file can contain two main types of things: definitions and actions.
