# Aim of This Guide

If you are new to programming or want to try it out but aren't really sure what it's all about, then this book is for you.  My goal is to build your fundamental skills and teach you how to use these skills to solve problems that you find interesting. 

I like to ask myself questions, so here goes a few:

**Q: With so many introductory books out there, why have you written another one?** 

Fundamentals are important. This book emphasizes covering fundamentals from a variety of angles so you simply can't forget them.

Also, there's the gap.  I'm talking about the gap between the books for anyone and the books for students at an educational institution.  The book for anyone often shies away from theory, while the book for the student necessarily presupposes that the student has calculus or statistics fresh in his or her mind. My hope is that I can tread somewhere in between these two approaches, teaching actual computer science as well as developing practical skills like problem-solving, creativity and meta-cognition(*). 

**Q: And why does this book use Python?**

The common truism is that Python is a good beginner language.  I concede this is true: Python code is fairly intuitive to write and read.  It has a great standard library and a great community as well. There is also a long term advantage, which comes from working in a language designed more or less by a single person who happens to be a great, practical-minded, language designer. You learn patterns that seem like facts now, but later on reveal themselves as wise choices. There is a reason why seasoned software developers with years in many languages come to Python and stay with Python.
