# Scope of this Book 

This guide is intended for new programmers, but can be useful to those familiar with other programming languages who want to learn Python.  If you have a solid grasp on programming fundamentals, feel free to skip the overview of terminology chapter.

The aim of this guide is to impart a bit of fundamental CS education as well provide practical guidance as to how to make a computer do what you want it to do with Python. If you are intimidated by the idea of programming, you've come to the right place. I hope to help you build enough confidence in your own reasoning skills so that you can divide a complex problem into simpler sub-problems and solve them in turn.

Sometimes, I will belabor a conceptual point. Other times, I will intentionally give you an open-ended problem with little guidance.  I want to offer quality exposition but also quality pedagogy.
